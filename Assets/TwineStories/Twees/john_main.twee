JANE: I just meant that it's nice to blend into crowds, and not be noticed by anyone. To just be one more face in a crowd.

JANE: It's good to know that no matter what he might look like, a man is always the same under the skin: selfish and totally unconcerned with the feelings of women.

JANE: And do you feel enlightened, now that you have?


:: I'm certainly not doing a very good job of disproving your point, am I?

:: But not a very good man.



:: At least you have a father.
